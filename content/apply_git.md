Summary: Invitation and Application Workshop Git/Github

## April 26, 2019: **Git/Github**

The Open Science Workshop Series continues. We are happy to announce our
upcoming Git/Github Workshop with Simon Schug.

**Version control**

Git keeps track of changes in your files and enables you to
store and restore specific versions.
Paired with an online repository, it helps you to transparently document the 
development of scientific data analysis pipelines (... and more!) and enables 
others to reproduce and reuse your work.

**Collaboration**

Github (and similar platforms, such as Gitlab) are internet-based platforms that
simplify using Git and allow collaborators to seamlessly collaborate
on the same project and code base without losing track of who did what and when.
Additionally, such platforms drastically facilitate sharing and maintaining of
open source code and enable you to systematically deal with bugs and updates.

**Equipment and software requirements**  
Please bring your laptop and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and 
sign up for an account at [github](https://github.com/) before the workshop.
A nice and short introduction how to set up git can be found
[here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

**Catering**  
Drinks and some snacks will be provided during the coffee breaks.
We would like to have lunch together at Sturm & Drang during lunch break.
Please indicate whether you would be interested in joining us for lunch by
filling in the respective fields in the registration form. 

**When and where?**  
Friday, 26th April, 9:30 - 17:00, PEG-Building, 1.G192 

Limited places are available. 
The workshop is, like all of our workshops, free of charge for members of the
Frankfurt Open Science Community.

Questions and comments can be sent to gagl@psych.uni-frankfurt.de.
