# Data Sharing, Privacy and Consent

## Informed Consent

According to the [Declaration of 
Helsinki](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/),

>**ยง32** For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as
>research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar 
>repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection,
>storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would 
>be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations
>the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a 
>research ethics committee.

Most recent EU laws also suggest a strong emphasis on informed consent, although [Hesse state 
laws](https://datenschutz.hessen.de/pressemitteilungen/gesetz-zur-anpassung-des-hessischen-datenschutzrechts)
grant much more freedom to academic research.

The DGPS (German Society for Psychology) has constructed and vetted a series of documents covering all stages 
of preparing an experiment according to the DSGVO (ger.)/GDPR (eng.), which you can find 
[here](https://www.dgps.de/index.php?id=185). We have adapted these documents, to be used at Goethe 
university:

Consider also the central clauses of the DSGVO and the specific legislature on the subject by the state of Hesse:

A [guide for sharing data](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) by Jeff Leek's group
gives a detailed overview for data sharing best practices.

However, for neuroimaging or other complex data, consider the 
[BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io) format.
