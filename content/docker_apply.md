# Docker Workshop
## 1st April, 2019

The Open Science Workshop Series continues. We are happy to announce our upcoming Docker Workshop held by Peer Herholz.

*Why Docker?*

- **Reproducibility** We are in a replication crisis. Docker tackles the technical side of this problem:
  by *containerizing* the software environment underlying a scientific analysis, others can exactly reproduce
  the analysis you did - or you can reproduce the analyses others did. Docker takes care of installing all of
  the relevant software in exactly the right configuration.
- **State Of The Pipelines** Docker makes it easy to access the software pipelines of methodological experts.
  It allows you to acces their analysis tools and easily apply them to your own data.


The respository for the workshop and a tentative schedule can be found [here](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/docker_ws_os_frankfurt/blob/master/README.md)
